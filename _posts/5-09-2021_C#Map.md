C# does not have exactly "Map" function but it has Dictionary<Tkey, Tvalue>

Map is formed by a key valud and mapped value.

Likewise, dictionary is formd by a combination with Tkey and Tvalue.
(Tvalue is differentiated by Tkey and they are paired)

There are number of field method for dictionary.

Add - you can add elements - .add(key, value)

```c#

Dictionary<int, string> person = new Dictionary<int, string>();
            person.Add(1, "Alice");
            person.Add(2, "Bob");
            person.Add(3, "Christine");
            foreach (var pair in person)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(pair);
            }

```

Change - you can change the value

```c#
person[2] = "Babara";
```

Automatic Addition - if a key does not exist, setting the indexer for that key adds an key/value pair.

```c#
person[4] = "Evan";
```

If key was requested and not in the dictionary, the indexer throws an "KeyNotFoundException"

```c#
Console.WriteLine("The owner of this SSN \"100\" is {0}", person[100]);
```

Remove - Remove.(key)

```c#
person.Remove(1);
```
